\chapter*{Afterwords}

This short story was written during 2023 as a fun little writing project between the two co-authors, Arthur von Helsinki and Teemu Koivisto. Sharing the same passion for the solitary hobby of writing, we wanted to try something different — what if we wrote a story together?

This was haphazardly decided and put in motion with the goal of writing, in turns, a chapter each week with no collaboration in-between \textit{where} the story should go. It would go where it wanted to go. In the end of course, we did have to together come up with an ending we both thought was the right one.

The idea for the story came perhaps from something the other author had said along the lines of not having the will or inspiration to write a bigger story. And that they rather indulged in the easy hedonistic stimulations instead. So as a kind of a joke, we took this tendency to the extreme — with a humorous tone.

We hope that \textbf{you}, dear reader, enjoyed it as much as we did writing it. The introspection of these themes has been fun yet somewhat revealing. Perhaps there is a higher truth to be learnt here. Or not. \textit{It's all meaningless anyway}.
