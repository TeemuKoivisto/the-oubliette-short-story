\chapter{Epigraph}

\begin{quote}
An \textbf{oubliette} (from french \textit{oublier} meaning to \textit{forget}) or \textbf{bottle dungeon} is a basement room which is accessible only from a hatch or hole (an angstloch) in a high ceiling. Victims in oubliettes were often left to starve and dehydrate to death, making the practice akin to — and some say an actual variety of — immurement.
